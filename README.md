## About <a name = "about"></a>

This project is a comprehensive repository that includes various data structures and algorithms as part of the Computing Engineering curriculum at UNIVESP. It aims to provide a practical resource for students to understand and implement classic data structures in C, enhancing their problem-solving skills and understanding of computer science fundamentals.

## Introduction <a name = "introduction"></a>

The goal of this project is to implement all basic data structures from computing studies, as delineated in the seminal textbook "Introduction to Algorithms, Fourth Edition" by Thomas H. Cormen et al. These data structures form the backbone of efficient algorithm design and are essential for solving complex computational problems.

### Basic Data Structures Included:

- **Linear Lists**: A sequential collection of elements that can be accessed based on their position in the sequence.
- **Stacks**: LIFO (Last In, First Out) structures where the most recently added element is the first to be removed.
- **Queues**: FIFO (First In, First Out) structures where the first element added is the first to be removed.
- **Linked Lists**: Collections of elements, called nodes, where each node points to the next node in the sequence, allowing for efficient insertion and removal.
- **Trees**: Hierarchical data structures used for various applications, including organizing data for quick search, insertion, and deletion.
- **Graphs**: Sets of nodes connected by edges, representing relationships between elements.
- **Hash Tables**: Structures that map keys to values for efficient data retrieval.
- **Heaps**: Specialized tree-based data structures that satisfy the heap property, where the key at the root is minimum or maximum among all keys present in the heap.

This list represents the foundational structures that will be explored and implemented in this project, starting with a detailed exploration of Linear Lists.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have a C compiler installed on your system. GCC, Clang, or any other standard C compiler will work fine.
