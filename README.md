## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

This project is a comprehensive repository that includes various data structures and algorithms as part of the Computing Engineering curriculum at UNIVESP. It aims to provide a practical resource for students to understand and implement classic data structures in C, enhancing their problem-solving skills and understanding of computer science fundamentals.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have a C compiler installed on your system. GCC, Clang, or any other standard C compiler will work fine.
